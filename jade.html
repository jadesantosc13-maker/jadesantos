	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Molly had been
	staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the 
	copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals
	her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.
	It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in
	these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had 
   spent the last trn years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
   oscar Wilde qoute proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who
   have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering 
   work, unraveling the secrets of the Ilama
   <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding 
   achivement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
